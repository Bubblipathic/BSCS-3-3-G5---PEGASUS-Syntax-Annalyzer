## 📖 About
PEGASUS is a toy programming language experiment that focuses on simplicity and readability.   

Instead of:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
}
```

You can just write:

```java
Show "Hello World!" one at a time, from 1 to 5
```

 - Input files must use the .pgs extension.
 - The symbol table generated will be saved in SymbolTable.txt.
 - This is a learning/project repo, not a production-ready language.
